# Reasoning about Correctness

## Tools to distinguish correct from incorrect algorithms

#### _Proof_

Proper mathematical proof consists of several parts

- Clear & precise problem statement
- Set of assumptions which are taken to be true used as part of the proof
- Chain of reasoning which takes you from assumptions to the statement you are trying to prove
- Lastly: Small squre or QED donating finish & representing _quod erat demonstrandum_

Proof is indeed a demonstration.
