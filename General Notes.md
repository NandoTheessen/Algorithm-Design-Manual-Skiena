# Introduction

#### Techniques

Accord to Skiena the most important techniques for algo design are:

- data structures
- dynamic programming
- depth-first search
- backtracking
- heuristics
- most importantly: modeling
  - in order to abstract a real application into
    a clean problem suitable to be solved by an algo

#### Resources

Helpful in tackling "new" problems:

- knowledge or many classic algorithmic problems which
  provide enough sufficient source material to model most any application

- the key: **not** to try and implement every new problem from stretch but to use the resources that are already there
