# Demonstrating Incorrectness:

- most effective way to prove an algorithm incorrect: - produce instance in which it yields an incorrect answer - important for this to be _verifyable_! one should provide - 1) the answer that said algorithm will give - 2) the correct answer (that the algo won't give) - Have a simple example! once a counter example is found, simplify it as much as possible!

Hunting counter examples is a great skill to have! Tools that help:

- Think small: - Small examples make for easier presentation - Usually when algorithms / heuristics fail, there is a v simple example as proof

- Think exhaustively: - if there is only a low amount of possibilities of how sets of problems are created
  and we are able to construct them in a small set do should

- Hunt for the weakness: - if proposed algos are unbalanced (greedy, always for the min etc)

      	- Go for a tie!: Breaks greedy heuristics
      	- Seek extremes!: many counter examples are mixtures of huge + tiny, far + near etc

**Take Home**:

- Searching for counterexamples is the best way to disprove the correctness of a heuristic
