# Expressing Algorithms

The three most common forms of notation:

- English
- Pseudo Code
- Real Code

#### which notation to chose:

- There naturally are tradeoffs between those 3
- The ultimate goal is clarity so chosing what we're most comfortable with is best

- common mistake: use pseudocode to "dress up" ill-defined idea to look more formal

**Take-Home Lesson:**

- Heart of any algo is an _idea_
- If the idea is _not_ clearly revealed when expressing it then you are using a too _low-level_ notation to describe it

# Problem and Properties

**In order to demonstrate correctness, we need a careful description of the problem**

- Problem specification have 2 parts:

1. Set of allowed input instances
2. Required properties of algos output

It's impossible to prove correctness for fuzzily-stated problems, as it might as well be undefined

An example for allowing to broad a class of inputs would be the non-overlapping movie problem, where we'd allow film projects to have gaps in production.

The algorithm is not able to handle such input (in fact there is no algorithm that exists for this input)

**Take-Home Lesson:**

- important to narrow set of allowable (problem)instances of input until there is a correct & efficient algorithm
  - Ex: restrict a graph problem from general graphs down to trees || geometric problem from one dimension to two

Common Traps when specifiying output:

- asking ill-defined questions
  - Ex: asking for the "best" route between two places
    - as "best" is undefined this is silly! (shortest? fastest?)
- compounding goals
  - chosing more than one criteria usually is not possible ex fast, efficient, shortest

Finding the right formulation for problems is an important part of solving them.
