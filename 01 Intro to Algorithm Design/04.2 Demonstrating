# Demonstrating Incorrectness:

 
- most effective way to prove an algorithm incorrect:
	- produce instance in which it yields an incorrect answer
	- important for this to be *verifyable*! one should provide 
	    - 1) the answer that said algorithm will give
	    - 2) the correct answer (that the algo won't give)
	- Have a simple example! once a counter example is found, simplify it as much as possible!

Hunting counter examples is a great skill to have! Tools that help:

- Think small:
